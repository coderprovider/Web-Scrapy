# Presentation

Today I present a very simple project(a task application), created with RactJS, Supabase as backend server (Firebase alternative) and using Tailwind CSS.

## Project Description

This project brings a very simple authentication in which we only use the email to log in, I show you the login page.

We put an email (any email works), after sending the email with which we want to enter, a message will be sent to the email which will redirect us to the page (it means that we are already logged in).Basically confirms our mail.

## Home Page

Entering the page we will find an animated sidebar (with Tailwind CSS), and a form to add a task, with two buttons below, one to see the tasks marked as "done" and the other to add a new task.

If there is no task, a white text will appear at the bottom of the form saying "No task found". 

### Sidebar

The sidebar can be extended and retracted (the accesses of the sidebar are not useful, they are simple decoration).

## Extra project data

- The work done has some errors

- The protection of the paths is not the best, as the goal of this is to use Supabase and learn some CSS from Tailwind.

- There are better ways to protect the paths, in the future I will fix the bugs I found (when I have free time).

- I am just learning Tailwind CSS so I was guided by some videos to make different styles.

## Thanks and goodbye

**Thanks for reading this brief description of the project, in the future I will add more things that I would like to add but due to lack of time I have not been able to, maybe I will try to replicate it with Python at some point. Greetings & bye bye. :heart:**
